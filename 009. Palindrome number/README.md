# Palindrome Number

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

A palindrome number reads the same forward and backward.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** 
```text
x = 121
```

**Output:** 
```text
true
```

**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```text
x = -121
```

**Output:** 

```text
false
```

**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.

### Example 3

**Input:** 

```text 
x = 10
```

**Output:** 

```text 
false
```

**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.

## Constraints

```text
-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
```

## Time Complexity

```text
O(log n)
```

---

## Space Complexity

```text
O(1)
```
